        <h2>What is Quality Assurance?</h2>
        <p>Whether you notice it or not, Quality Assurance (QA) is all around us. From the software we use, to the cars we drive, and to the buildings we use to have trainings in, QA is an essential part of our life. But what exactly is Quality Assurance? Quality Assurance, in general terms, is the maintenance of a level of quality in a service or product in stages of the process of delivery or production. QA can be seen heavily in construction, software, or creation of a product. If QA was not implemented in our lives, the world would be catastrophic. <a href ="http://info.ibs-us.com/blog/bid/51517/The-Importance-of-Quality-Assurance-Top-3-Quality-Failures" target="_blank">One example would be the 2009 Toyota Car Recall</a> which led to dozens of people losing their lives. </p>
        <h2>Software Testing/Quality Assurance</h2>
        <p>At Year Up, trainees embark upon a two phase system. The first system is called Learning and Development. In this phase, trainees are taught Business Communications, Professional Skills, Computer Hardware and Software, and depending on which track students are placed into, they are also taught IT Support, Project Management, Quality Assurance, and Cyber Security. In the second phase, trainees will have earned their internship through demonstrations during Learning and Development. This is where trainees will gain valuable corporate experience so that they can land a career after the program.</p>
